# Ride Request Analysis - Tableau Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **Tableau Dashboard** designed to analyze ride request patterns. The dataset consists of ride requests with details like request time, dropoff time, pickup points, and ride status. The objective is to identify key trends in ride demand, incomplete requests, and supply-demand relationships.

## Dataset Information
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- **Request ID**: Unique identifier for each ride request.
- **Date**: Date when the ride was requested.
- **Request Time**: Time when the ride was requested.
- **Dropoff Time**: Time when the ride was completed.
- **Pickup Point**: The location where the customer requested pickup.
- **Driver ID**: Unique identification number of the driver.
- **Status**: The ride status (Completed, Canceled, No Driver Available, etc.).

## Key Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard provides insights on:
1. **Peak Demand Time Slots**
   - Identifying major time slots with high ride requests.
   - Analyzing patterns across different days and hours.
2. **Factors Affecting Incomplete Requests**
   - Examining the causes of incomplete requests (e.g., cancellations, no available drivers).
   - Correlating request status with time, pickup points, and demand trends.
3. **Supply-Demand Relationship**
   - Comparing the number of ride requests vs. driver availability.
   - Identifying gaps where demand exceeds supply.

## Installation & Usage
To explore the dashboard:
1. Open the **Tableau Workbook (.twbx)** file in **Tableau Desktop**.
2. Navigate through different visualizations to analyze ride request patterns.
3. Use filters to focus on specific time periods, pickup points, and request statuses.
